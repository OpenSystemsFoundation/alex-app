# Technical Solution Design for LWC Kanban Board with Redux-like Global State and Domain Driven Architecture

## Overview

The Lightning Web Component (LWC) Kanban Board application supports drag-and-drop functionality, real-time updates using Salesforce Platform Events, and a Redux-like global state management for high-performance collaboration. Additionally, it uses an FFLib-inspired Domain Driven Architecture to ensure a clean separation of concerns and maintainable code. This document covers the architecture, components, state management strategy, domain logic, and real-time data synchronization.

### Goals and Requirements

-   **High-Performance Collaboration**: Real-time synchronization for multiple users using Platform Events.
-   **State Management**: Use a centralized, Redux-like state to maintain a consistent state across components.
-   **User Experience**: Smooth drag-and-drop operations with instant visual feedback.
-   **Scalability**: Scalable to handle high-frequency state changes across multiple users.
-   **Domain Separation**: Maintain a modular architecture leveraging FFLib principles to encapsulate business logic.

## Solution Architecture

The Kanban board consists of several interacting parts:

1. **LWC Components** for UI rendering.
2. **Redux-like State Management** for predictable state updates.
3. **Domain Layer** for encapsulating business logic using FFLib-inspired Apex classes.
4. **Apex Controller** to interact with Salesforce data and publish Platform Events.
5. **Platform Events** for real-time updates.

### Component Breakdown

### Component Breakdown

The Kanban Board application is implemented as a single LWC component that includes the following key parts:

1. **Kanban Board (Main Component)**
    - Orchestrates the child components and manages the overall state.
    - Sets up listeners for Platform Events and initializes the global state.
2. **Column Component**
    - Represents a specific stage in the Kanban workflow (e.g., To-Do, In Progress, Done).
    - Manages the rendering of its respective cards.
3. **Card Component**
    - Represents individual tasks within a column.
    - Handles drag-and-drop operations, invoking state updates.
4. **Drag-and-Drop Handler**
    - A utility library enabling drag-and-drop functionality for cards across columns.
    - Triggers actions that result in state updates.

### State Management

-   **Redux-like Global Store**:
    -   The application uses a custom global store implemented in JavaScript to maintain a centralized state.
    -   The global state holds data for Kanban columns, cards, and users interacting with the board.
    -   Actions are dispatched to update the state, which triggers a re-render of components as needed.
-   **Actions and Reducers**:
    -   Actions are dispatched on events such as **updating a card** or **dropping a card** into a column.
    -   Reducers handle these actions, creating a new state that reflects the changes.

### Domain Driven Architecture with FFLib

-   **Domain Layer**:
    -   The business logic is encapsulated in a dedicated Domain Layer.
    -   **Domain Classes** are created for each major entity, such as `ColumnDomain` and `CardDomain`, to manage core logic, making the application more maintainable and easier to extend.
-   **Service Layer**:
    -   The **Service Layer** handles orchestration logic that interacts with multiple domain classes.
-   **Selector Classes**:
    -   Selector classes are used to fetch data efficiently from Salesforce, ensuring FLS/CRUD compliance and reducing the number of queries.
-   **Repository Classes**:
    -   The repository classes are used to abstract the data access layer, providing a clean separation between the domain logic and data retrieval.

### Drag-and-Drop Functionality

-   **Implementation**:
    -   Native HTML5 Drag and Drop event support
    -   Upon dropping a card, an action is dispatched to update the global state.
-   **Instant Visual Feedback**:
    -   The dragged card is visually moved across the board, with immediate rendering of the new state to provide a responsive UX.

## Real-Time Updates with Platform Events

-   **Platform Events**:
    -   To maintain consistency for all users, changes made by one user are broadcast via **Platform Events**.
    -   When a user moves a card, a Platform Event is published via Apex. Other clients listen to these events and sync their local state.
-   **Event Listener Setup**:
    -   The Kanban board subscribes to these Platform Events through the `empApi` module in Salesforce LWC.
    -   Upon receiving an event, the event handler dispatches an action to the Redux-like store, updating the state.

### Data Persistence

-   **Apex Controller**:
    -   All changes are persisted to Salesforce using an **Apex Controller**.
    -   The Apex methods interact with the **Domain Layer** and **Service Layer** to ensure the business logic is reused consistently.
    -   The **Domain Layer** is responsible for triggering the Platform Event after data changes, ensuring other users' views are updated.

### Real-Time Update Flow

1. **User Action**: A user drags and drops a card from one column to another.
2. **State Update**: A `MOVE_CARD` action is dispatched to the Redux-like store to update the local state.
3. **Server Update**: An Apex method is called to persist the change in Salesforce, leveraging domain methods.
4. **Event Publishing**: Apex publishes a Platform Event indicating the update.
5. **Other Clients Update**: Other instances of the Kanban board receive the Platform Event, triggering an update of their local state.

## Security and Access Control

-   **FLS/CRUD Compliance**: Apex controllers and domain classes are built to check user permissions and field-level security, ensuring data integrity.
-   **Event Filtering**: Platform Events include metadata to filter events that are not relevant to the current user.

### Technology Stack

-   **LWC**: For building the UI components.
-   **Apex**: For server-side operations, including persistence and Platform Event publishing.
-   **Platform Events**: For enabling real-time synchronization across clients.
-   **Custom JavaScript Store**: For Redux-like state management.
-   **empApi**: To subscribe to Platform Events.

## Conclusion

The LWC Kanban Board app is designed to provide an engaging and collaborative user experience with drag-and-drop, real-time updates, and robust state management. By leveraging Platform Events, a centralized Redux-like store, and an FFLib-inspired Domain Driven Architecture, the application ensures smooth, scalable, and high-performance interactions, while maintaining a modular and maintainable codebase.
